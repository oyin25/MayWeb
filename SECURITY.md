## 🔒 Security Best Practices for MayWeb Users

While we strive to keep MayWeb secure, here are a few steps you should take on your end:

- Avoid modifying internal `.js` files unless you understand what you're doing
- Keep your system antivirus and firewall active
- Only run MayWeb on trusted machines and environments
